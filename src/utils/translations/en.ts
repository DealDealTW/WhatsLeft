  markItemAsWastedAnswer: 'When you mark an item as "Wasted", it is removed from the Dashboard and counted in your waste statistics. This data appears in the waste analysis on the "Insight" page, helping you identify the types of items you waste most often, so you can improve your shopping and storage habits.',
  
  // Insight page related
  whatInformationInsightPageShow: 'What information does the "Insight" page show?',
  insightPageShowAnswer: 'The Insight page displays four key metrics: the number of unique items tracked, usage efficiency percentage, units used, and units wasted. Additionally, it provides detailed analysis of category usage, category efficiency, and most frequently wasted items.',
  
  // Advanced features
  advancedFeatures: 'Advanced Features',
  cameraQuestion: 'How does the barcode scanning feature work?',
  cameraAnswer: 'The barcode scanning feature allows you to quickly add items by scanning product barcodes. When adding an item, select the barcode icon and point your phone at the product barcode. If the product is in the database, relevant information will be automatically filled in; otherwise, you\'ll need to enter it manually.',
  voiceInputQuestion: 'How does voice input work?',
  voiceInputAnswer: 'Voice input lets you add items by speaking, which is especially useful for adding multiple items at once. Select the microphone icon, then clearly say the item name and quantity (e.g., "two cartons of milk"), and the system will attempt to recognize and fill in the relevant information.',
  autoSubcategoryQuestion: 'How does automatic subcategory selection work?',
  autoSubcategoryAnswer: 'When you enter an item name, WhatsLeft attempts to identify the product type and automatically select the appropriate subcategory (such as "Dairy", "Meat", "Cleaning Supplies", etc.). You can enable or disable this feature in settings.',
  familySizeAdjustQuestion: 'What is the family size auto-adjustment feature?',
  familySizeAdjustAnswer: 'This feature automatically adjusts recommended purchase quantities based on your set number of family members. For example, a family of four typically consumes more meat, vegetables, etc. than a single-person household. This setting mainly affects the shopping list feature, making it easier for you to shop for the entire family.',
  batchSelectionModeQuestion: 'How do I use batch selection mode?',
  batchSelectionModeAnswer: 'On the dashboard, tap the "Select" button in the top-right corner to enable batch selection mode. After selecting the items you want to manage, action buttons appear at the bottom: mark as used, mark as wasted, or delete. This is useful for managing multiple items at once.',
  
  // Dashboard management
  dashboardColorsQuestion: 'What do the colors on the dashboard mean?',
  dashboardColorsAnswer: 'The colors indicate item urgency based on expiry date: Green means safe (not expiring soon), Yellow means expiring soon (within 3-4 days), and Red means expired or expiring today/tomorrow. This helps you prioritize what to use first.',
  dashboardNotificationIconQuestion: 'What is the notification icon in the top right corner?',
  dashboardNotificationIconAnswer: 'The bell icon in the top right corner indicates items needing attention. Tapping it filters the dashboard to show only items that are expiring soon or have already expired, helping you quickly see what needs immediate use.',
  
  // Views and filters
  howToFilter: 'How do I filter my items?',
  filterAnswer: 'Tap the filter button in the top-right corner of the dashboard, then select the category to display (All, Food, or Household) and urgency level (All, Expiring Soon, or Expired). You can also select specific subcategories to further filter items.',
  howToSort: 'How do I sort items?',
  sortAnswer: 'Tap the sort button in the top-right corner of the dashboard, then choose a sorting method: by name (alphabetical order), by expiry date (earliest expiring first), or by quantity (highest to lowest).',
  howToGroupItemsBySubcategory: 'How do I group items by subcategory?',
  groupItemsBySubcategoryAnswer: 'On the dashboard, tap the filter button in the top-right corner, then select the "Group by Subcategory" option. This will group items by subcategories (such as "Dairy", "Meat", etc.), making it easier to manage large inventories.',
  canSearchForItems: 'Can I search for items?',
  searchForItemsAnswer: 'Yes, tap the search icon or search bar at the top of the dashboard and enter an item name or subcategory keyword. Search results will display in real-time, matching both item names and subcategories.',

  viewStatsDifferentPeriodsAnswer: 'At the top of the Insight page, tap the timeframe dropdown menu to select: This Month, Last Month, Last 3 Months, or Last 6 Months. All statistics will update according to the selected time period.',
  howIsUsageEfficiencyCalculated: 'How is "Usage Efficiency" calculated?',
  usageEfficiencyCalculatedAnswer: 'Usage Efficiency = (Units Used ÷ Total Units Tracked) × 100%. Total Units Tracked is the sum of Units Used and Units Wasted. This metric measures the proportion of items you effectively use (rather than waste).',
  howToSeeWastedItems: 'How do I see my most frequently wasted items?',
  seeWastedItemsAnswer: 'On the Insight page, scroll down to the "Wasted Items" card, which lists items you\'ve marked as wasted, sorted by quantity. Tap "Show more" to see the complete list. This helps identify items you should buy less of or manage better.',

  howDoesFamilySizeSettingAffect: 'How does the family size setting affect my shopping list?',
  familySizeSettingAffectAnswer: 'When adding items to the shopping list, the app automatically adjusts suggested purchase quantities based on your family size setting. For example, categories like "Meat", "Seafood", and "Fruits & Vegetables" increase proportionally with family size. Premium users can customize multipliers for each subcategory.',
  howToMoveShoppingListItems: 'How do I move shopping list items to my main inventory?',
